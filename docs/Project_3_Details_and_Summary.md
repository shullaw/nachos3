<div class="text_to_html">Understanding ReadAt and WriteAt.<br /><br />
Suppose I want to copy content from a pointer executable to a buffer, we do like this<br /><br />
executable-&gt;ReadAt(buffer,size_to_copy, offset_to_read_from_executable);<br /><br />
The above statement will copy the content of the executable of the given size_to_copy into the buffer from the given offset.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Now, if I want to write the content from the buffer to executable, we do<br /><br />
executable-&gt;WriteAt(buffer, size_to_copy, offset_to_write_on_executable);<br /><br /><br /><br />
During page fault, you are copying a single page (bad virtual page) from executable or a swap file into the main memory (free physical page). So this is how we do it.<br /><br />
 executable-&gt;ReadAt(&amp;(machine-&gt;mainMemory[freePhysicalPage*PageSize]), PageSize, badVirtualPage*PageSize);<br /><br />
Here, ReadAt first argument should be the location where we want to write the page, which is given by <br /><br />
&amp;(machine-&gt;mainMemory[freePhysicalPage*PageSize]) . <br /><br />
Since we are writing a single page, our second argument of size should be PageSize .<br /><br />
The third argument should be the offset from where to copy and which is given by the badVirtualPage*PageSize<br /><br /><br /><br />
Now, if a page is dirty we need to write the content of the main memory into the swap file of the replacing thread. so we just do that using write at. <br /><br />
executable-&gt;WriteAt(&amp;(machine-&gt;mainMemory[replacingPhysicalPage*PageSize]), PageSize, badVirtualPage_of_replacing_thread*PageSize);</div>

when iterating through the pagetable of replacing thread, you need to first check if a pagetable is valid before you check if that pagetable physical page is associated with the physical page you are trying to replace. A pagetable content is valid only if it’s valid bit is true.</div>
